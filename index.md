## Maths & TikZ

I have been working my way through Leonard Susskind's Theoretical Minimum (classical mechanics) book and accompanying on-line video lectures. The combination is superb. The actual aim is to work through the Quantum Mechanics book and video lectures, but I had to rewind to A level maths and physics in order to take a run at the harder stuff.


I have taken notes as it helps things sink in. I have found [LaTeXiT](http://www.chachatelier.fr/latexit/) to be brilliant for constructing the mathematical formulae, with the resulting text strings pasted into Scrivener (ScML workflow) ready for compilation to PDF. I also discovered [TikZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) for diagrams, and a lovely little program called [TikZ-Editor](https://github.com/fredokun/TikZ-Editor) which is nice and minimal, like LaTeXiT, for faster edit-compile cycling. The TikZ documentation is something of a highwater mark for quality.

## MkDocs

Following the posts of jcw at [Jeelabs](http://jeelabs.org/book/1551c/index.html "Why doesnâ€™t this dream setup exist?"), I decided to implement a static website. From the many choices I liked the default theme of [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/ "MkDocs home") best, after narrowing my choice based on Python and MarkDown.
