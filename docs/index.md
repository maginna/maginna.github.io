## Cinder

Converted this site from a [mkdocs]( https://www.mkdocs.org/) default to [Cinder](https://sourcefoundry.org/cinder/). The trickiest aspect was me mistakenly putting tab characters in the YAML otherwise it was straight-forward.

## A5 Booklets

Working with [pgfmorepages](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgfmorepages?lang=en) to produce an A5 booklet with notes on Etching technique.  I was doing an afternoon class at the Putney School of Art & Design. Then we had lockdown.

## Python Environments

Goodness I am making heavy weather of this, but I have now been trying [pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in addition to [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) on the mac. My machine is nearly 8 yo, so it is littered with my fiddling, but still it shouldn't be hard. Anyway I have whatever default pythons apple provide on the machine, the latest package from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and two pyenv pythons (2.7.8 & 3.8.2).  Probably a recipe for trouble but that is where I am.  I upgrade [pcbmode](https://github.com/boldport/pcbmode) to cinco, and it is working.
