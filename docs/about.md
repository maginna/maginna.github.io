##About me

I am older person pretending to stay in touch with technology.

I am presently learning LaTeX and particularly Tikz, the latter directly, and also using [TikZiT](https://tikzit.github.io/).

I am also learning more [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)  using nophead's [NopSCADlib](https://github.com/nophead/NopSCADlib).

I am a patron of the [Royal Institution](https://www.rigb.org/) which means nothing more than giving a little extra to support it.  I have enjoyed some magical evenings at the lectures.

I am a patron of the [De Morgan Collection](https://www.demorgan.org.uk/) which cares for the art and legacy of Evelyn and William De Morgan.
